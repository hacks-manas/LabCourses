# DAALab
Design and Analysis of Algorithms (Lab)

***
Each Week - X is a directory with each problem having its own subdirectory,
each subdirectory contains 3 files - 
* The program : named as the corresponding problem number : 1.cpp
* The input test cases file : input.txt 
> (Every problem has been tested with at least the sample input test cases)
* and the output file : output.txt
***

## Week 1 : 
- Problem 1 : Linear Search for a target element in an unsorted array of positive integers, print the number of total-comparisons made.
- Problem 2 : Binary Search for a target element in a sorted array of positive integers, print the number of total-comparisons made.
- Problem 3 : Jump Search for a target element in a sorted array of positive integers, print the number of total-comparisons made. 
  - (jump size : 0, 2, 4, 8, ... , 2^k)
## Week 2 :
- Problem 1 : Find duplicates of a target element in a sorted array of positive integers, print the target and corresponding duplicates.
- Problem 2 : Find three indices i, j, k in a sorted array of positive integers such that arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[k], if such indices are present print them as a sequence, or print "No Sequence found".
- Problem 3 : Find number of pairs of integers in an unsorted positive integer array such that their difference is equal to a given target element, K.

## Week 3 :
- Problem 1 : Use Insertion sort to sort a given array, print the total number of comparisons and shifts made.
- Problem 2 : Use Selection sort to sort a given array, print the total number of comparisons and swaps made.
- Problem 3 : Find if duplicates of a given target element are present in an unsorted positive integer array, print YES/NO as an answer.

## Week 4 :
- Problem 1 : Use merge sort to sort a given array of positive integers, print the total number of comparisons and inversions made.
- Problem 2 : Use quick sort to sort a given array of positive integers, print the total number of comparisons and swaps made.
- Problem 3 : Find the kth smallest element in a given unsorted array of positive integers.

## Week 5 :
- Problem 1 : Use counting sort to find and print the maximum number of occurences of an element in an unsorted array of alphabets (containing duplicate elements).
- Problem 2 : Find whether two elements exist such that their sum is equal to the given key element, in an unsorted array of integers. (2-sum problem)
- Problem 3 : Given two sorted integer arrays of size m and n, find list of elements which are common to both.
